The `@apply` directive is not suitable for handling pseudo-selectors.  Instead of using `@apply` directly on classes with pseudo-selectors, apply the styles directly in your component's CSS or use a utility-first approach.  For instance, instead of `@apply hover:bg-blue-500` on a class, add `hover:bg-blue-500` directly to the element's style within your component's template or use the relevant Tailwind utility classes in the template directly.

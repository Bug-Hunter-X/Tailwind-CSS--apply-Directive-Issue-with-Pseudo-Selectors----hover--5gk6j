This bug occurs when using Tailwind's `@apply` directive with a class that contains a pseudo-selector like `&:hover`.  The `@apply` directive doesn't correctly handle the pseudo-selector, causing the styles to not be applied on hover. For example, applying a class with hover styles within a parent element won't work as expected.  This often manifests as styles not working on hover even when the class appears correctly applied in the dev tools.
